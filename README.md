I completed the concept of react use state in which I create a state that store and track the property name color and the setColor function that update the color property
# what can state hold ? 
The useState hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!
# example is in the app.jsx file now  
so in next step I completed the learning of use multiple useState in the MultipleUseState.jsxfile
# one more thing like
I also saparate the OneUseState.jsx for use only one useState into file
# second thing like
saparate the MultiPleState.jsx for use MultipleUseState.jsx file

# why I write multiple useState in example: 

because I want to learn things like one thing is useState contains many type of items like string, number, objects , arrays so thats why I implement that thing

one more thing like we also created multiple usestates into one component

# so can we do things of multiple useState with only one useState : 

so the answer is yes 
we will do this with the help of an object

so for this i create new component that name is MultipleUseStateAlt

because it is alternatiive of this
