I completed the concept of react use state in which I create a state that store and track the property name color and the setColor function that update the color property
# what can state hold ? 
The useState hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!
# example is in the app.jsx file now  
so in next step I completed the learning of use multiple useState in the MultipleUseState.jsxfile
# one more thing like
I also saparate the OneUseState.jsx for use only one useState into file
# second thing like
saparate the MultiPleState.jsx for use MultipleUseState.jsx file
